# Mean, median, and mode
    Mean, median, and mode are different measures of center in a numerical data set. They each try to summarize a dataset with a single number to represent a "typical" data point from the dataset.


Mean: The "average" number; found by adding all data points and dividing by the number of data points.
Example: The mean of 4, 1, and 7 is (4+1+7)/3 = 12/3 = 4

// Normal formuls
mean = sum of data points / count of data points

// Formally formula
mean = ∑Xi/n
​

Median: The middle number; found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle (or if there are two middle numbers, taking the mean of those two numbers).
Example: The median of 4, 1, and 7 is 4 because when the numbers are put in order the number 4 is in the middle.
To find the median:
    Arrange the data points from smallest to largest.
    If the number of data points is odd, the median is the middle data point in the list.
    If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle data points in the list.

    
Mode: The most frequent number—that is, the number that occurs the highest number of times.
Example: The mode of [2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4] is 2 because it occurs 4 times,
